A WordPress plugin to track and report on specific URL calls containing unique 'festival ID' parameters, providing daily and global statistics directly in the dashboard.

## Overview

The **Festival ID Tracker** WordPress Plugin is designed to provide custom, in-dashboard analytics for websites using unique identifiers in their URLs, such as those generated by NFC tags or specific campaign links. It offers a straightforward way to monitor engagement and traffic related to these unique IDs without needing to navigate external analytics platforms for this specific data.

This plugin creates two informative widgets directly within your WordPress admin dashboard:

1.  **Festival ID Daily Statistics:** Offers a daily breakdown of total page accesses and the number of unique 'festival IDs' encountered over a 7-day period. Includes navigation to view historical weekly data.
2.  **Festival ID Global Statistics:** Provides a comprehensive overview of every unique 'festival ID' ever recorded, showing its total accesses and the number of distinct days it has been active. The list is initially limited to the top 5 most active IDs, with an option to expand and view all.

## Features

* **Custom URL Parameter Tracking:** Specifically designed to log accesses to URLs containing `?id=XXXXXX` (where `XXXXXX` is a 6-character alphanumeric string).
* **Database Logging:** All tracked calls are securely stored in a custom WordPress database table.
* **Daily Engagement Reports:**
    * Displays total calls per day.
    * Shows unique `festival_id` count per day (where each unique ID is considered a unique user for that day).
    * 7-day rolling window with intuitive `<<` and `>>` navigation for historical data.
* **Global ID Performance Reports:**
    * Lists all unique `festival_id`s recorded since tracking began.
    * Shows the total number of accesses for each `festival_id`.
    * Indicates the number of distinct days each `festival_id` has been active.
    * Results are sorted by total accesses in descending order.
    * Defaults to showing the top 5 most active IDs with an option to "Show All" and "Show Top 5."
* **Dashboard Integration:** All statistics are conveniently presented as widgets on your main WordPress admin dashboard.
* **Lightweight & Efficient:** Built directly within WordPress, minimizing external dependencies.
